# Depreciated! Please refer [this] repo from now on for updates.

# Important:
- Intention: Test pre-releases in a controlled environment to prevent connecting with incompatible versions on IOHK network and also have a stable environment to learn/study.
- Remember: To avoid spamming logs of nodes of other network (invalid block0), please ensure to not re-use IP-port combination between different networks
- Also Remember: Before starting node for the first time, ensure respective storage/db folders are empty
- Cap: Pools intending to run their stake pool have been distributed 1000000000 Test Lovelaces, would be great if we use it as a cap.
- The information below is not complete and only intended for usage between the operators using these networks.
- For helper scripts, these are either copies - or small modifications of IOHK provided helper scripts to keep them compatible with versions here.
